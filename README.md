Hi,

I am Stefan Hackstein, extragalactic astrophysicist and cosmologist. I want to learn about the magnetic fields in the Universe and their origin. For this, I look at at messengers with extreme energies, e. g. Fast Radio Bursts and Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays. For this, I investigate cosmological simulations and use Bayesian statistics to compare predictions to observations, trying to expand our knowledge about the Universe, its history and the fascinating phenomena we find in it.

Here you can find all my publications, talks and other information about me. 
If you are interested in any of this, please write me an email: stefan.hackstein@hs.uni-hamburg.de
