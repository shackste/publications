Hi,

I am Stefan Hackstein, extragalactic astrophysicist and cosmologist. I want to learn about the magnetic fields in the Universe and their origin. I look at at messengers with extreme energies, e. g. Fast Radio Bursts and Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays. I investigate cosmological simulations and use Bayesian statistics to compare predictions and observations, expanding our knowledge about the Universe, its history and the fascinating phenomena we find in it.

Here you can find all my publications, talks and other information about me. 
Please do not hesitate to write me an email: stefan.hackstein@hs.uni-hamburg.de

I'm author of the PrEFRBLE python package, build to interpret FRB observations
